ICMGP 2019: Achieving data management, visualization and analysis
================
Geoffrey Millard, Caitlin Eger, and Jackie Gerson

Welcome to the site for 2019 International Conference on Mercury as a Global Pollutant 2019 Workshop on Achieving data management, visualization and analysis. Please review the [Introduction to R material](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/cgeger/ICMGP2019/blob/master/Introduction-to-R.html) before attending the course with us on **Sunday, September 8th** from **9:30 am to 12:00pm**.

See you in Krakow!! *-Geoff, Caitlin and Jackie*

Workshop Description
--------------------

#### Learning to use R, an open-source statistical software package

See a hands-on demonstration using real data and learn to use the open-source statistical programming software R (<https://www.r-project.org/>) for data management, visualization, and analysis. Statistical management can get expensive. Learning this open-source software helps researchers everywhere keep their costs down while still allowing them to make significant contributions to the body of mercury science.
