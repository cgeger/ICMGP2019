================
Geoffrey Millard, Caitlin Eger, and Jackie Gerson

Welcome to the site for 2019 International Conference on Mercury as a
Global Pollutant 2019 Workshop on Achieving data management,
visualization and analysis. Please review the [Introduction to R
material](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/cgeger/ICMGP2019/blob/master/Introduction-to-R.html)
before attending the course with us on **Sunday, September 8th** from
**9:30 am to
12:00pm**.

## Workshop description: Learning to use R an open-source statistical software package

See a hands-on demonstration using real data and learn to use the
open-source statistical programming software R
(<https://www.r-project.org/>) for data management, visualization, and
analysis. Statistical management can get expensive. Learning this
open-source software helps researchers everywhere keep their costs down
while still allowing them to make significant contributions to the body
of mercury science.

See you in Krakow\!\!
